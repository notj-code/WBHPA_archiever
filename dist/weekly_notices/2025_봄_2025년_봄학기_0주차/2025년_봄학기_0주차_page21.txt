1. EN Report: 1 on 1 Meeting
At the beginning of the semester, students in the EN class participated in one-on-one meetings with their teachers. These sessions encouraged students to set personal goals and take ownership of their learning. By fostering self-awareness, teachers guided students in assessing their current progress and planning their next steps. Through thoughtful guidance and encouragement, these conversations set the stage for a semester in which students actively shape their learning journey, cultivating a meaningful and purposeful educational experience.

2. SAP Report: Use Computer Wisely or Be Used
SAP courses involve extensive research, writing, and presentations. As a result, students often find themselves using their computers more than their peers. This increased reliance on technology, while useful, can lead students to depend too heavily on the internet for help, such as for critical thinking, or to miss out on opportunities to practice and improve their English skills using online tools. Moreover, many studies have expressed concerns about this potential over-reliance on digital aids like chatbots, which could limit users' exploration of alternative problem-solving strategies and potentially restrict students' critical thinking abilities. Consequently, SAP students are subject to stricter computer usage guidelines. Students are encouraged to plan their computer use carefully, specifying the necessary times and purposes, thereby training their thinking, planning, and self-management skills. By adhering to these guidelines, students not only harness technology effectively but also ensure they do not overlook valuable opportunities to enhance their academic and personal growth.
