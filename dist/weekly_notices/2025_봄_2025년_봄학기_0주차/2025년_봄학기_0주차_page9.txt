1. EN Report
Equipped with new textbooks that match both the students’ interests and abilities, our English classes will continue to enhance our students' language skills while encouraging them to be creative and adaptive. We believe that language is more than a tool for communication; it is a gateway to understanding different cultures and perspectives. This semester, we are focused on instilling Wanbang values through various activities, challenging students to break through their limits, and fostering cooperation. We aim to create an English classroom that goes beyond being a traditional learning space—it becomes a Powernasium, where students use English as a tool to continuously develop their sevenpower.

2. SAP Report
SAP has begun regular classes during the WIC period. Courses in SAP bring together students from different grade levels and cultural backgrounds, fostering a unique learning environment. Beyond academics, SAP provides students with distinctive experiences, including counseling and its associated courses.
What matters most is that the strengths of the SAP Track build upon the foundational learning that all students experience at our school. When students cultivate the Seven Powers through values such as gratitude, challenge, passion, and responsiveness, the differences they encounter in SAP become meaningful catalysts for growth and transformation.
As we enter a new semester, we hope students will embrace even more training opportunities within SAP and continue to develop their powers.
